        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pad see ew is a stir-fried noodle dish that is commonly eaten in Thailand. It can be found
            easily among street food vendors and is also quite popular in Thai restaurants around the 
            world. The origins of the dish can be traced to China from where the noodle stir-frying 
            technique was brought. Pad See Ew is salty, balanced with a touch of sour and a wonderful 
            chargrilled flavour which you can create at home!
