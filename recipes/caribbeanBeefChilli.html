        <p>

        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Basmati Rice</li>
            <li>Coconut Milk</li>
            <li>Carrot</li>
            <li>Beef Mince</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Chilli Flakes</li>
            <li>Caribbean Seasoning</li>
            <li>Mint</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, bring the coconut milk, water (for the rice) and a generous 
                pinch of salt to the boil. Add the basmati rice, stir, cover with a lid and reduce 
                the heat to low. Cook for 15 minutes, then remove the pan from the heat and keep 
                covered until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed, 10 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>While the rice is cooking, grate the carrot. Finely chop the garlic. Drain the 
                sweetcorn. Heat a large frying pan over a high heat. Cook the sweetcorn until lightly 
                charred, 4-5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. 
            </li>
           
            <li>Return the frying pan with a drizzle of olive oil over a medium-high heat. Cook the 
                beef mince, breaking up with a spoon, until browned, 4-5 minutes. Add the carrot, 
                garlic and mild Caribbean jerk seasoning and cook until fragrant, 1-2 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>Add the mango chutney, tomato paste, water (for the beef), salt and a pinch of chilli 
                flakes (if using) to the beef mince. Stir to combine and simmer until heated through, 
                2 minutes. TIP: If you prefer a saucier chilli, stir in 1-2 tbs of water just before 
                serving.
            </li>

            <li>While the chilli is simmering, finely chop the tomato. Pick and roughly chop the mint 
                leaves. Add the tomato, mint, white wine vinegar and a drizzle of olive oil to the 
                corn. Season to taste and stir to combine. 
            </li>

            <li>Divide the coconut rice and Caribbean beef chilli between bowls. Serve with the 
                tomato-mint salsa.
            </li>
        </ol>
